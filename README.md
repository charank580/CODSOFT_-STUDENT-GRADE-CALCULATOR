# DESCRIPTION:
The given program is a simple yet effective Student Grade Calculator written in Java, which helps in determining the overall performance of a student based on the marks obtained in different subjects. At the beginning of execution, the program imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which allows it to take input directly from the user through the console. Inside the main method, the program first displays a welcome message to the user, making the interface more interactive. It then prompts the user to enter the total number of subjects, and this value is stored in the variable ns. An integer array named marks is then created with a size equal to the number of subjects, allowing the program to store marks for each subject. Another variable called total is initialized to zero, which will be used to accumulate the sum of all marks. The program then enters a for loop that runs from 0 to ns - 1, where in each iteration it asks the user to input marks for a particular subject. A validation step is included using a while loop to ensure that the entered marks are always between 0 and 100. If the user mistakenly enters an invalid number, the program displays an error message and again asks for a valid input. Once valid marks are provided, they are stored in the array, and the same value is added to the total variable. After all subjects are processed, the program calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects, ensuring that the division is done in double precision to get accurate decimal results. Next, the program determines the grade of the student based on the calculated percentage using a series of conditional if-else statements. The grading logic follows a simple scheme: 90% and above corresponds to grade ‘A’, 80–89% is ‘B’, 70–79% is ‘C’, 60–69% is ‘D’, 50–59% is ‘E’, and anything below 50% results in grade ‘F’. After computing the grade, the program neatly displays the results section where it prints the total marks obtained by the student, the average percentage rounded to two decimal places using printf, and the final grade. Finally, the scanner.close() statement is used to close the Scanner object to prevent resource leakage, which is considered a good practice in Java programming. Overall, this program is interactive, user-friendly, and demonstrates several important programming concepts such as user input handling, arrays, loops, conditional statements, validation, and formatted output. The way it runs is straightforward: when executed, it asks the user how many subjects are involved, collects marks one by one with proper validation, computes the total and percentage, decides the grade using conditional logic, and then presents the result in a structured format. This makes it a practical example of applying core Java concepts in solving a real-world problem where performance evaluation of students is required. Such a program can be further extended by including features like highest and lowest marks, subject-wise grades, or GPA conversion, but in its current form, it successfully demonstrates the essentials of creating a functioning grade calculator.
